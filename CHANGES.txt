Changelog
---------

In next release

 - Added getXMLSerializer() and getHTMLSerializer() method to make it easier
   to obtain an XMLSerializer iterable conditionally in code.
   [optilude]
 
 - Renamed the 'parser' argument to the @lazy decorator to 'serializer', since
   that's what it is: the function that turns a tree into a string.
   [optilude]

 - Refactored decorator to support use with instance methods.
